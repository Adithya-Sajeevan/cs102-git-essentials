First execute the command,
git --version
to check whether git is installed. 

To add our credentials to git, use the following.
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "Your Email"

You may also add the following settings to avoid issues with line endings.
git config --global core.autocrlf input
git config --global core.safecrlf true

Use this to check whether our computer already has an SSH key generated. 
ls -la ~/.ssh | grep 'id_rsa'

This will list two entries 'id_rsa' and 'id_rsa.pub'. Otherwise create key pair by,
ssh-keygen -t RSA

Now execute,
cd .ssh
cat id_rsa.pub
and copy the content to "GitHub Settings > SSH and GPG Keys > New SSH Key" to set up SSH key.

Execute the following to clone your repository to the current working directory in your machine.
git clone git@github.com:<Your GitHub Username>/<Repository Name>.git

Now use,
cd <Repository Name>
then execute,
git remote -v
to check whether remote origin is already be setup,

Add a file using 'touch <filename.extension>' command. 
Now type 'git status' to show current status of the repository. 
It must show 1 untracked file present as a new file is added but not staged.
So we need to use this command to stage the file to the repository
git add <filename.extension>
Now checking 'git status' shows no error.

Use this to commit the changes we have done in the repository.
git commit -m "Comment about the change"

Once the change is commited, use this to push to the server.
git push

We can make changes in GitHub website and pull that change to our local machine by using,
git pull

For a better visualisation of your repository with all details, execute,
git log
